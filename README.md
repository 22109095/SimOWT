This repository is the project page for the paper [A Simple Baseline for Open-World Tracking via Self-training](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3581783.3611695)

## Highlight
- SimOWT is accepted to ACMMM 2023.

## Overview
We propose SimOWT, a simple baseline for Open-World Tracking(OWT). Our method demonstrates **state-of-the-art** result on the TAO-OW benchmark.
